This sets the height of the html, body and root elements to 100% of the viewport. 

For example, if the viewport height is 800px, all three elements will have a height of 800px. 

This is useful for example when you want to create a full-screen background image or a full-screen container that takes up the whole viewport. 

Without this, the height of the html and body elements would be the height of their content, which could be smaller than the viewport height.
